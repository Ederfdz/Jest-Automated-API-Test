# Sprint 7 project

For this project we will be testing different endpoints using the Urban Grocers API. We will use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and create tests for each endpoint. Initial project files repo will be cloned from Github. Updated project changes will be commited and pushed.
Javascript, Jest, and Node will be used in this project.
Javascript will be the language used to write our tests. It will be used in conjunction with Jest, a Javascript Testing Framework that will help us run our tests. Node will be used as our Javascript runtime environment as well as our package manager.
Code style used in this project is camelCase, each test having a descriptive title, and comments are provided for each test to explain what respective test does.

- Open terminal in project directory and run $ npm install
- Start server and copy its address
- Insert address inside of API_URL variable value in the config.js file
- Run $ npx jest to run all tests
  OR
